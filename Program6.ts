//6. Stripping Names: Store a person’s name, and include some whitespace characters at the
//beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and
//"\n", at least once. Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed.
//Then print the name after striping the white spaces.
