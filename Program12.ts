//12. Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing
//each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message
//should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let StrArray:string[]=["Fuzail","Uzair","Ali","Naeem"];
